## üß© Function Overview

Below is a full list of Blueprint nodes included in the library:

| Function | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `PrintDebug` | Prints a category-tagged message to screen/log based on dev settings. |
| `PrintDebugAutoCategory` | Automatically tags messages with the calling object's name. |
| `DrawDebugTextAtActor` | Draws floating text at an actor‚Äôs location with custom offset. |
| `DebugTraceResult` | Performs a trace and logs the result onscreen and in the log. |
| `PrintActorInfo` | Outputs actor name and location to the screen. |
| `DrawDebugCapsuleSimple` | Draws a single capsule with color, size, and orientation. |
| `DrawDebugArrowFromActor` | Draws directional arrow (Forward, Backward, Up, Down, etc.) from actor. |
| `DrawDebugPath` | Connects an array of points with debug lines (great for pathfinding). |
| `DrawDebugSphereArray` | Draws a series of debug spheres for visualizing many points. |
| `HighlightActorOnce` | Draws a debug box around an actor‚Äôs bounds. |
| `LogActorComponentHierarchy` | Logs the actor's component tree to the log and debug history. |
| `RunDebugConsoleCommand` | Executes a console command and logs it to the debug history. |
| `LogDebugToFile` | Appends a message to a text file in the `Saved` directory with timestamp. |
| `GetRecentDebugMessages` | Returns the full runtime history of recent debug messages. |
| `ClearAllDebugLines` | Clears all persistent debug visuals from the current world. |
| `SetDebugCategoryEnabled` | Enables or disables a debug category at runtime. |
| `IsDebugCategoryEnabled` | Checks if a specific debug category is currently enabled. |

## üóÉÔ∏è File Logging Location

Using the `LogDebugToFile()` function? Here's where your saved logs end up:

- **Folder Path:** `[YourProject]/Saved/[FolderName]/[FileName].txt`
- For example: `Saved/Logs/GameplayDebug.txt`

You can specify both the folder and file name via Blueprint when calling the function.

‚úÖ Log messages are timestamped and appended to the file.  
‚úÖ The log folder will auto-create if it doesn‚Äôt exist.

This is useful for saving runtime debug sessions for review after a crash, playtest, or session reset.

## üìÇ How Debug Categories Work

You can use `SetDebugCategoryEnabled("MyCategory", false)` to toggle off a category and mute all associated messages or visuals. Every log respects its category status before displaying.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Debug Message History

Every function in this library automatically logs its activity to a **runtime-accessible message history**, retrievable via `GetRecentDebugMessages`.

The system stores up to 50 recent messages.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Where do I find Debug Function Library nodes in Blueprint?**  
**A:** All nodes are under the `Debug ‚Üí Advanced` category in the Blueprint context menu.

**Q: Will these functions work in packaged builds?**  
**A:** No. All debug logic is excluded from shipping builds via `#if !UE_BUILD_SHIPPING`.

**Q: Can I filter or disable debug messages during runtime?**  
**A:** Yes! Use `SetDebugCategoryEnabled(CategoryName, false)` to toggle any category on/off dynamically.

**Q: Is this safe to use in multiplayer or networked projects?**  
**A:** Yes. These nodes are strictly visual/debug-only and have no gameplay side effects.
